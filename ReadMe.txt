Bomberman: Game is 2-4 players.

Run the server first and input a port (I have used 1000) (this does not default to anything)
Then run the client on the local / separate machine.

Connect to the server by filling out the ip & port fields (these default t o 127.0.0.1 and 1000), username is only for gameplay but not actually important.

W/A/S/D to move Up/Left/Down/Right.
Spacebar to place bombs on the ground.
Kill all other players with bombs.
